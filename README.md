# WixUiDesigner
### A Visual Studio extension providing visualization for WiX UI dialogs.

_This project is still in its initial development phase and not even ready for tests._

The name is a little bit misleading as this will probably never become a "designer".  
This extension will visualize the layout of WiX dialogs in an editor margin when editing a `*.wxs` file
in Visual Studio.

Any suggestions or comments are already welcome.
