## Welcome

WiX UI Simulator will be a Visual Studio extension that can simulate dialogs you design with the [WiX tool set](https://wixtoolset.org/) at design time in your IDE.

Normally you have to build your WiX project, then start the MSI (which often takes a while to initialize and collect data, too) to finally see how the changes to your wxs will actually look
like. WiX UI Simulator helps your design process by rendering the dialog in an editor margin while you edit the `*.wxs` file.

_This project is still in the initial development phase and not even ready for tests._
